This is an extremely simplified version of a game like Colossal Cave Adventure and assignment for Operating Systems Course. This is written in C.

3) Run the game by typing "./adventure" in the command prompt (while in the same folder).

This program will generate a maze, write files to a disk, correctly read files from the disk into a maze and then allow the player to solve the Maze.

The files are named after the room. The files are written as:

ROOM NAME: <room name>
CONNECTION 1: <room name>
…
ROOM TYPE: <room type>

Room type "START_ROOM" is the start of the maze. "END_ROOM" is the end of the maze.

Players are prompted with screen:

CURRENT LOCATION: <room name>
POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS: <list of connections>
WHERE TO? > <input data>

A valid, correctly capitalized and spelled input will move user from room to room. If input is incorrect it will be generate the following error message:

HUH? I DON’T UNDERSTAND THAT ROOM. TRY AGAIN.

Once the end room is succesfully navigated to the end game prompt will generate. It will look something like this:

YOU HAVE FOUND THE END ROOM. CONGRATULATIONS!
YOU TOOK 2 STEPS. YOUR PATH TO VICTORY WAS:
Wally-Room
Lounge
%

The room files are housed directory "stinero.rooms.<pid>". The created directory is not deleted after the program has completed. All unnessesary files can be deleted by typing "Make clean".
